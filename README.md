# Meta Explorer

A Shiny R App which queries Uniprot via SPARQL endpoint to retrieve information from a list of protein IDs.

UniPathways, KEGG Orthologs, BioCyc IDs and Gene Ontologies are displayed along with graphical plots showing the frequencies of the pathways and gene ontologies in the dataset processed.

For BioCyc pathways a file called uniprot2pathways.txt needs to be prepared with the list of Uniprot IDs and the associated pathways and placed into a data/ directory in the app folder (BioCyc needs a registration).
